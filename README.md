## Why?
This website was built out so I could continue to update it with new things throughout my progamming journey.  It will serve to showcase my skills as a developer for potential employers.  I want all of my links to be easily available for whoever looks at my profile.

## Hurdles
The biggest hurdles I ran into was getting my CSS to work properly.  I feel I hadn't spent enough time working on CSS prior to this project and I really honed a lot of skills I feel I was lacking during the development proccess of this project.
